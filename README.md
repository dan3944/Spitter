# What is Spitter?
Spitter fills an unmet niche in the social media market - people who want to check their Twitter while blindfolded.

Every time someone who you've followed on Spitter tweets, Spitter will call you and read their tweet out loud to you.

# How do I sign up?
To follow someone, text "Follow twitter_handle" (without the quotes) to 617-858-8543. For example, "Follow realDonaldTrump". It is not case-sensitive.

To unfollow someone, text "Unfollow twitter_handle" (without the quotes) to 617-858-8543. For example, "Unfollow realDonaldTrump".
Note: this is (temporarily?) down until I get more Amazon S3 credits.
